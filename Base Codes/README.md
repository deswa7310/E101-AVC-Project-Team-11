- The files within this folder are the separate programs used for each maze (core, completion, and challenge), **NOT OUR FINAL PROGRAM.**
- We have preserved these base programs for documentation purposes.
- Our final program is simply called "**robot.cpp**" and is within both the "**Team 11 Robot**" folder and the "**AVC_Win10.zip**" folder (inside **AVC_robot**).
- "**robot.cpp**" is a combination of all three programs; cleaned, tested, and optimized to work for any of the three mazes.
