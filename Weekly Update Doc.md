# WEEKLY UPDATE #1

#### Week 10 starting June 8th

We are mostly on track according to our plan which we have finalised at the end of last week. 
We have :
- Succesfully installed SMFL on all our computers (devices used)
- Everyone has access to the Github Repository
- Working on code for Core 
- (add some progress stuff)

### Personal Messages

Tristan:
- Once the week is over, I'm going to clean the slate and upload these onto the wiki for archival purposes
- For every change longer than two lines from now one. it helps show progress and is easier to combine <br>
than every person having different code that needs to be considered separately
- Please add the appropriate labels to any pull requests you do. Adding labels helps sort out and if you assign people, it will notify them
- Also please use this page for discussions
