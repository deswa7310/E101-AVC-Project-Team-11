# WEEKLY UPDATE #2

#### Week 11 starting June 15th
Continuing with our plan, we have made progress with the AVC:

- Finished working on the core code
- Finished working on the completion code

#### Personal Messages

Tristan
- I haven't fully researched into it, but I'm fairly certain that the code shouldn't need user inputs. The core and completion should be able to be merged without much modification to existing code. The challenge can also be added in, since it just detects red.


Shivam (will update on the 19th before submission due)
- Will be double checking the codes and testing it myself to see if everything works well. (will keep you updated)
- Optimising code/debugging to enhance performance - may need someones help on this if anyones availible
- Will make sure the github is all up to date, instructions are clear and to make sure everythings in order before we get marked  
- *REMEMBER* to make progress on the logs and the individual reports


John
- Okay guys, so we now have all 3 codes functional, but in separate programs.
- I think you're right Tristan; it'll take some rearranging and tweaking but there definitely is a way to fit all 3 into one program without needing user input. I'll try experimenting with it later today.
- Shivam has also brought to my attention that we don't need to submit our code and it will simply be taken from our repository on the day of marking.
#### In terms of our plan, here is a brief analysis from my perspective:
- Our plan was made on schedule.
- GitHub was operational and everyone had the AVC programs working ahead of time.
- Due to assignments among other hurdles, we made a late start on designing the core code.
- Core code was finished 3 days behind schedule.
- However, completion code was finished 4 days ahead of schedule. (Yay!!)
- Due to our early finish of completion, we had more than sufficient time to do challenge.
- Challenge code was operational 4 days ahead of program deadline.
- The plan held together for the most part, it was just a bit shakey at the start due to assignments and other work conflicting with our planned schedule.
- However, we quickly caught up and worked to get ahead of schedule.
- In my opinion, our greatest challenge was juggling the project with our other assignments. As our assignments were due sooner, we prioritised those and fell behind schedule on the project. When the number of other assignments finally dropped, our rate of progress jumped up and we quickly raced through the code around a week before the deadline. Thanks to contributions from the whole team, we have the base of our project all done and just need to tweak and polish some things before we reach submission time in a few days.
