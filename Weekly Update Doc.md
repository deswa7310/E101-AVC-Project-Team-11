# WEEKLY UPDATE #2

#### Week 11 starting June 15th
Continuing with our plan, we have made progress with the AVC:

- Finished working on the core code
- Finished working on the completion code

#### Personal Messages

Tristan
- I haven't fully researched into it, but I'm fairly certain that the code shouldn't need user inputs. The core and completion should be able to be merged without much modification to existing code. The challenge can also be added in, since it just detects red.


Shivam (will update on the 19th before submission due)
- Will be double checking the codes and testing it myself to see if everything works well. (will keep you updated)
- Optimising code/debugging to enhance performance - may need someones help on this if anyones availible
- Will make sure the github is all up to date, instructions are clear and to make sure everythings in order before we get marked  
- *REMEMBER* to make progress on the logs and the individual reports


John
- Okay guys, so we now have all 3 codes functional, but in separate programs.
- I think you're right Tristan; it'll take some rearranging and tweaking but there definitely is a way to fit all 3 into one program without needing user input. I'll try experimenting with it later today.
- Shivam has also brought to my attention that we don't need to submit our code and it will simply be taken from our repository on the day of marking.
- In terms of our plan, here is a brief analysis from my perspective:

Jayen
- Since the challenge code has been completed this week i will be testing the code and seeing if i can find different ways to optimise the code to make it possibly more efficient
- I will also be reading through everything that we have written down to make sure that there are no errors
- Ive been making sure to show up to the labs in order to be sure we have not missed any relevant information which could be helpful
- I have also been making sure to kepp up with my weekly logs and writing down how i have contributed to the group
