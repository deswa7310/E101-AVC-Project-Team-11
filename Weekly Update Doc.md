Continuing with our plan, we have made progress with the AVC:

- Finished working on the core code
- Finished working on the completion code

#### Personal Messages

Tristan
- I haven't fully researched into it, but I'm fairly certain that the code shouldn't need user inputs. The core and completion should be able to be merged without much modification to existing code. The challenge can also be added in, since it just detects red.


Shivam (will update on the 19th before submission due)
- Will be double checking the codes and testing it myself to see if everything works well. (will keep you updated)
- Optimising code/debugging to enhance performance - may need someones help on this if anyones availible
- Will make sure the github is all up to date, instructions are clear and to make sure everythings in order before we get marked
