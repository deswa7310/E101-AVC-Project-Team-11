## Roles
(NOTE: these are not the final roles, please help me define what these are what they should do)

Primary roles: (The main “job” of the member)
- Project Manager: In charge of team planning and execution; plans meetings, ensures we meet deadlines, reports progress regularly.
-	Software Architect: In charge of general design of program; writing the core code and planning how it should work.
-	Software Writer: In charge of execution of the program; debugging, testing, and expanding the code, committing with each update.
-	System Administrator: In charge of managing operations on GitHub; organises files, writes instructions on using program etc.

Secondary roles: Components of what the member’s primary job is; does not have to relate to what their primary role is. Should not have more than two (unless you have other ideas)
-	Writing code
-	Debugging and executing tests
-	Documentation and logging: performance, errors encountered, etc
-	Optimising code


Backup roles: a role someone can carry out if another member is currently unavailable or help with a member currently struggling to perform. Can be primary or secondary
