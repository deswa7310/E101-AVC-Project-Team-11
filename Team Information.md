(NOTE: these are not the final roles, please help me define what these are what they should do)

Primary roles: The main “job” of the member Project Manager
-	Software Architect: description
-	Software writer: description

Secondary roles: Components of what the member’s primary job is; does not have to relate to what their primary role is. Should not have more than two (unless you have other ideas)

-	Optimising code
-	

Backup roles: a role someone can carry out if another member is currently unavailable or help with a member currently struggling to perform. Can be primary or secondary
